    Parameters
    ----------
    content: :class:`str`
        The content of this text display. Up to 4000 characters.
    row: Optional[:class:`int`]
        The relative row this text display belongs to. By default
        items are arranged automatically into those rows. If you'd
        like to control the relative positioning of the row then
        passing an index is advised. For example, row=1 will show
        up before row=2. Defaults to ``None``, which is automatic
        ordering. The row number must be between 0 and 39 (i.e. zero indexed)
    id: Optional[:class:`int`]
        The ID of this component. This must be unique across the view.
